What were some challenges you faced while making this app?

The first challenge that we have is passing the random generated password to the database, because we're not familiar enough with state and set state, and how to use other render methods. 
We were also struggling with designing and implementing the navigation bars. I'm done  Nerf bars navigation bars. Finally, we were having trouble deploying the web service on Render.com. 

Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make

If we had more time, we will definitely put encryption (both visually and in database) on the passwords because now our design is very insecure for users. We will also do  pop-up windows for communicating. We would consider implementing the search bar as well. We think this is a very useful function.

What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?

The assumptions we made are: in order to access the password manager page, users must first log in; upon clicking the submit button, all entered data is saved; users can designate which character types (alphabet, numbers, and symbols) to include in the created password by using checkboxes; if any necessary field is missing or incorrect, error messages will be shown; passwords cannot be shared within the user themselves; the shared username the user enters needs to be in the database.

How long did this assignment take to complete? (Obviously, this does not need to be a paragraph) 

This project took us about a week to finish.
